# OCR
Extracted text from images using Google Vision API and AWS
Rekognition API. Various Image Processing techniques were
applied to images before extracting text for improving accuracy.
Also compared the results with Googleâ€™s Tesseract OCR engine
applied on OpenCV EAST model for text extraction.
From the bounding boxes we can see that histogram equalisation improves the result.
